# DSA-SecondProject-COMP242
Write a calculator program. A minimal calculator will support the following functions:
• numbers with decimals (not just integers) 
•addition (1 + 2 is 3) ➔ + 
• subtraction (12 - 4 is 8) ➔ - 
• multiplication (33 * 2 is 66) ➔ * 
• division (3 / 8 is 0.375) ➔ / 
• modulus (10 % 3 is 1) ➔ % 
• parentheses ( “5*((4+6)/2)” ) ➔ ( , ) 
• factorials (4! is 4*3*2*1, a.k.a. 24) ➔ ! 
• error messages when you do something wrong (illegal equation). 
Ex: 6.5 * (4+2 / (3.2*3) Error: Missing parentheses Your program should use the cursor implementation of the linked list to implement the Stack.
Your Program should support other features -might look at the documentation for “java.lang.Math” to find help with some of the below functions -.
